## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in a variety of applications. However, their deployment in streaming applications poses challenges related to computational efficiency and memory usage. This theoretical proposal aims to extend the concept of attention sinks by introducing a dynamic mechanism for their identification and application.

## Background

The StreamingLLM framework keeps the Key and Value states (KV) of initial tokens (attention sinks) and the most recent tokens to manage computational and memory resources efficiently. This static setting is based on empirical observations that these specific tokens are particularly important for maintaining performance.

## Proposed Methodology

### Phases

1. **Initial Phase**: Start with statically defined attention sinks.
2. **Accumulation Phase**: Allow the model to generate tokens up to a predetermined limit.
3. **Analysis Phase**: Run statistical analysis to identify new attention sinks.
4. **Update Phase**: Update the attention sinks based on this new analysis.
5. **Reset Phase**: Reset the token counter and repeat the process.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. Initialize the model with static attention sinks.
2. Let the model run until it reaches a predetermined token limit.
3. Perform statistical analysis on the model's attention distribution.
4. Identify new attention sinks based on the analysis.
5. Update the model's attention sinks.
6. Reset the token counter.
7. Repeat steps 2-6.

## Potential Advantages

1. **Adaptability**: The model could adapt to different types of sequences or tasks over time.
2. **Efficiency**: By only running the analysis periodically, the computational overhead could be minimized.
3. **Stability**: Starting with proven static attention sinks could ensure that the model remains stable and effective during the initial phases.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Influence of Initial Static Attention Sinks

#### Potential Implications

1. **Skewed Analysis**: Initial static attention sinks might skew the statistical analysis.
2. **Inertia in Adaptability**: The model might be less responsive to changes.
3. **Suboptimal Performance**: The model might perform suboptimally until the next update phase.

#### Possible Solutions

1. **Normalization**: Apply normalization to the attention scores.
2. **Weighted Analysis**: Weight the statistical analysis.
3. **Periodic Re-evaluation**: Increase the frequency of the dynamic update.
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use a combination of static and dynamically identified attention sinks.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The proposed dynamic attention sink mechanism offers a balanced approach to managing the computational and memory resources in streaming LLMs. Future work will involve the empirical validation of this theoretical approach to assess its effectiveness and efficiency.
